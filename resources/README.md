# Resources 

In this directory you can find the resources that I've been using to learn Reinforcement Learning algorithms and theory:

- [Reinforcement Learning - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)
- [Reinforcement Learning Specialization - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning Course - Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction)
- [Reinforcement Learning - DeepMind / UCL](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)

The courses take up to 90 + 25 + 40 hours to complete at a chill pace (Avoid binging education :). Notes can be found at the **notes** directory.
