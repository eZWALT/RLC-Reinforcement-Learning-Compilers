# RLC - Reinforcement Learning and Compilers Resources  
## Description 
Different resources, courses, projects and markdown notes that I've used to to learn Deep and Classical Reinforcement Learning + Evolutionary strategies and Optimization algorithms + MIT Introduction to Deep Learning course. I'm simply sharing my learning journey, given that I want to dive deep into deep-learning, reinforcement learning and compiler optimization, so I hope it helps anybody!
## Contents
